Favorite Top Ten Website

You are to make a multi-page website that talks about your favorite items in a top ten style. This will be a group assignment, 2 per group. Each person will pick a topic and make a top 10 of it.

Aaron Robinson peer review: The code looks organized and the page is formatted well. I really like the use of the bootstrap elements. The only thing I would change is the tile of the page. It is still bootstrap demo. Great Job
